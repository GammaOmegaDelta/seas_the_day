Fuji, but unlike the mountain, the flower is pronounced by stressing the second syllable. One of the best places to view fuji flowers is the Ashikaga Flower Park (あしかがフラワーパーク) in Ashikaga City, Tochigi Prefecture. Ashikaga Flower Park features lots of blue, white and pink fuji, as well as yellow laburnum (Japanese: kingusari) that look like yellow colored fuji. One large fuji tree is 100 years old and its branches are supported to create a huge umbrella of blue fuji flowers. There is also a long tunnel of white fuji flowers, while a tunnel of yellow kingusari needs a few more years to become an actual tunnel.

The gold leaf used for Kinkaku Soft is a real gold.  There are a lot of grade to the gold leaf, but we selected the one with higher content of gold and using the special food grade gold leaf.  Also, based on the research on brain wave and emotion, it vitalizes the left brain and distress after eating pure gold.  It also states eating pure gold gives you comfortable feeling.  Very luxurious experience eating pure gold also gives you a good effect to your heart. Vanilla flavor is with rich raw milk. Matcha flavor is with stone-ground high grade matcha powder. Because of this delicate cream, the color would change if it’s not fresh. Topped with small rice cake ball, sweet azuki beans, and whipped cream, it’s like a parfait on the go. Kinkaku Soft used Japanese traditional crafted paper called washi for the cone sleeve.  To get the deep color, we are using the best of kind washi Genryu and put gold and silver leaf and embossed our logo.  The craftsman specially made this washi for Kinkaku Soft.
