****<-- Need to make admin to be the only one editing/deleting activities. Figure out how a user can delete an activity and edit it rather than the whole activity itself within the itinerary. Go to localhost:8080/activityusers/2/edit  -->****



***TO-DO/Questions***
- How to get a current user's itinerary(full of activities they chose)to show up? ActivityUsersIndex??
-How can a user delete one single activity within their itinerary?

-How can a user make a new itinerary list to choose items from rather than entering manually?
  -side note: new itinerary needs to be adjusted to be able to pick activities from home and add them to user's itineraries.

-Should a router link for your itinerary be made to be on the top? Home|login|your itinerary|

-change home.vue to what we had in our old app with css?? what was home.vue treat it as show/index ti see all itineraries?
