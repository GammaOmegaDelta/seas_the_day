**Activites controller needs data**

Made associations between category, itinerary, category_itinerary. Next step? Possibly make associations with WISHLIST. Make routes and views for activities followed by wishist, may wanna hold off on the associations between wishlist until routes and views are made. Will an Image model be necessary? If so, it will belong_to :itinerary under the Image model and has_many :images under the Itinerary model. Will the Itinerary model also need validations?? eg. validates :name, presence: true and so on?? 



--Postpone status will be an update action, make sure to add into activities controller and make sure it works before making the postpone/update action.---

--Thailand??---

~-~-~-Itineraries with html?(See mini_capstone)~-~-~-

---Should Itinerary be switched to activity and voce versa to make more sense?
