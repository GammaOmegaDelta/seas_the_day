Japan List🇯🇵

Hello!😀 I just finished creating my sightseeing/food joint places I'd like to visit while in Japan! Just heads up anything with the little squiggly line like this > ~~~ < means tentative and depends really on how our schedule overall looks like and whether or not you guys would be up for it as it is a little out of the way from where we might be so missing these things on the list wouldn't be that big of an issue. Please note that I categorized Food Joints & Street Food as 2 different categories. Food Joints are vegan friendly places near each city that I personally can go to for food, of course please join me if you'd like, as for the Street Food category, that is most likely not vegan friendly but I'd be willing to try some food and probably just nibble off whatever you get or we can order something that catches our eyes and just share it. Please feel free to look over my list and message me back with any concerns/questions you may have. *Just came to mind that I did not mention a place in osaka that I actually wanted to visit. I believe it's called the Dotonbori district where they have that big giant crab displayed on a store front and it's a big food market as well so let's add that place to our list well my list to be exact 😅just added it to the list but I haven't done too much research on that place but it'll fall under Street Food so most likely not vegan friendly options there so I'll let you guys take the wheel once there though I do wanna try some crab from that big crab displayed store! **Last thing to add, for souvenirs I reccomend Don Quijote, Daiso(everything in this store is only 100 yen!!!) & Tokyu Hands. I believe these places should be located in Tokyo so if we want we can do souvenir shopping towards the last days of our trip since we'll be in Tokyo and can go to these places! We can always play it by ear or souvenir shop as we go, just suggesting😀
